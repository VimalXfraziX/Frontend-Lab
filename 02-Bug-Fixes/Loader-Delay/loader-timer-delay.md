# 🐞 Bug: Loader Timer Not Completing on Mobile

---

## 🧩 Issue Description

When testing a GSAP-based loader animation with a timer (from 0 to 100), the loader worked perfectly on desktop. However, on mobile devices, the timer often **didn't reach 100** before the loader finished its animation.

### 🔍 Observations:
- The counter should reach 100 in approx **2.5 seconds** (`25ms * 100`).
- On **mobile**, the loader often disappears early, with the counter stuck at 80–90.
- This creates an **incomplete user experience**.

---

## 💣 Root Cause

The issue occurred because:

- The **GSAP timeline** and the **`setInterval()` countdown** were **running in parallel**.
- On **slower or throttled mobile devices**, `setInterval()` doesn't run at perfect intervals (due to frame drops or CPU constraints).
- GSAP continued the timeline while the timer lagged behind.

---

## ✅ Solution

Pause the GSAP timeline until the countdown completes manually. Only resume the timeline after the timer hits 100.

---
## 🛠️ Code Fix

### ✅ Updated GSAP + Countdown Sync Logic:

```js
tl.add(() => {
  let countdown = document.querySelector(".countdown");
  let count = 0;

  let interval = setInterval(() => {
    if (count <= 100) {
      countdown.textContent = count++;
    } else {
      clearInterval(interval);
      resumeTimeline(); // ✅ Resume only after timer completes
    }
  }, 25);

  tl.pause(); // ⏸️ Pause the GSAP timeline until countdown ends
}, "+=0.3");

// Resume GSAP timeline when timer completes
function resumeTimeline() {
  tl.resume();
  // Continue rest of loader animation
}
```

## 🎯 Result

- ✅ Timer and animation are now perfectly synced.
- ✅ Loader waits for countdown to complete — even on mobile devices.
- ✅ Bug no longer occurs on low-performance or throttled environments.

## 📌 Notes
- setInterval() is not guaranteed to be accurate on all devices. Always manually sync long timers with animation timelines.
- This method works well with GSAP timelines, where animation control (pause/resume) is needed.
